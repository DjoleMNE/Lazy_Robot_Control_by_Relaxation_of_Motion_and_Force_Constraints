 * Implementation based on:

 * "Model-Free Friction Observers for Flexible Joint Robots With Torque Measurements",
 * in IEEE Transactions on Robotics, vol. 35(6), 2019.

     *                        This input value should be between 0 and 1. Higher the number means more noise needs to be filtered-out.
