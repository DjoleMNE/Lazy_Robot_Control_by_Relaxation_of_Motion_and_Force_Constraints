                      OROCOS RTT Tutorial

This directory contains exercises for exploring the Orocos Real-Time
Toolkit in order to learn how to create Orocos components.

Each exercise compiles out of the box. It is your task to extend it
such that it becomes more functional.

Start with the hello-1-task-execution directory and work your way down
until you have done all hello-* examples.  The assignment can be found
at the top of each HelloWorld.cpp file.

When you're done with the hello-* examples, proceed with the
controller-1 example, which has instructions in its Exercise.txt file.

Requirements: Orocos Real-Time Toolkit and the Orocos Component
Library's DeploymentComponent and TaskBrowser component are installed
in /usr/local for the 'gnulinux' target. Edit the Makefile and change
the OROPATH value if this is not the case in your setup.

Feel free to contribute other examples on Orocos.org.

Have fun!
